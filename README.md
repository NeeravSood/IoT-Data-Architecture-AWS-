# Predictive Maintenance System for Mine-IT

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the predictive maintenance system designed for Mine-IT, a mining company looking to enhance operational efficiency and equipment reliability. The system leverages Amazon Web Services (AWS) to process data from IoT devices installed on mining equipment, detect potential failures, and facilitate proactive maintenance actions.

## Architecture
The predictive maintenance system is built using various AWS services to ensure scalability, robust data management, security, and real-time processing capabilities. Key components include:
- **AWS IoT Core**: Manages IoT devices.
- **AWS Kinesis Data Streams and Data Analytics**: Handles real-time data streaming and analysis.
- **AWS Lambda and S3**: For data processing and storage.
- **AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift**: Data warehousing and analytics.
- **Amazon SageMaker**: Machine learning for predictive maintenance.
- **AWS IAM and KMS**: Security and access management.
